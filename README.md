# Formulario-de-Veterinaria
With PROGRAMA DESDE TU CASA I am taking a course of Introduction to Web Programming.  As a homework we must create a form  for a veterinarian.  I used the semantic HTML tags and for the form: &lt;form>, &lt;label>, &lt;input>, &lt;select> and &lt;buttom> and give some style with css.
