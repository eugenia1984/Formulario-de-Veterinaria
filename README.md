#Formulario de Veterinaria
## What I did 🚀

With PROGRAMA DESDE TU CASA I am taking a course of Introduction to Web Programming. <br/>
As a homework we must create a form  for a veterinarian. <br/>
I used the semantic HTML tags and for the form I use FORM, LABEL, INPUT; SELEC and BUTTOM tags and gave some style with css.<br/>
In orden to see the information the people coemplete in the form I linked with Formspree.
